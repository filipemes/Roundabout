# Autonomous Car Interaction at Roundabouts

The aim of this project is to implement a roundabout with multiple lanes and
entrances/exits and vehicles behave independently and concurrently.

## Data Structures

The Roundabout is the main structure of this project, contains the main logic of this project like car detection,  calculation of the shortest path given a destination, etc. For represention of the road network we used Directed Graph vertices, allows us to represent all paths. For the calculation of the shortest path we used Depth First Search algorithm.
